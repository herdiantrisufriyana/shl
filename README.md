## System requirements

We used R 4.0.2 programming language (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) to conduct 
data analysis. The integrated development environment software was 
RStudio 1.3.959 (RStudio PBC, Boston, MA, USA). To ensure reproducibility, we 
used Bioconductor 3.11;12 thus, versions of the included R packages were all in 
sync according to versions in this Bioconductor version. For statistical 
machine learning, we used an R package of caret 6.0.86 that wraps R packages 
for a modeling algorithm, which was glmnet 4.1. We created R packages for 
many steps in the data analysis, which are:
[medhist 0.1.0](https://github.com/herdiantrisufriyana/medhist), and 
[gmethods 0.1.0](https://github.com/herdiantrisufriyana/gmethods). 
Details on other R package versions and all of the source codes (vignette) for 
the data analysis are available in shl.Rmd.

To reproduce our work, a set of hardware requirements may be needed. We used a 
single machine. It was equipped by 8 logical processors for the 3.40 GHz 
central processing unit (CPU) (Core(TM) i7-4770, IntelÂ®, Santa Clara, CA, USA), 
and 16 GB RAM. But, one can use a machine with only 4 logical processors and 
4 GB RAM, if the sample size is smaller than that of dataset we used in this 
protocol.


## Installation guide

Please follow through the R Markdown (shl.Rmd). Installation approximately 
requires ~15 minutes.


## Demo

All codes require ~10 minutes to complete for non-expensive computation. We 
provided pre-existing files to substitute the expensive computation. One can 
set a variable that defines whether the expensive parts will be conducted. This 
may take from hours to 2 days to be completed.

We also provide small datasets to demo the 2 packages we made for this study. 
Please follow through the vignettes. These show simple examples to demo the 
packages.


## Instructions for use

Briefly, all system requirements, installation guide, demo, and instructions 
for use are available in R Markdown (prom.Rmd) and other files in this 
repository.

The R Markdown (.Rmd) contains the same texts with this document but including 
the programming codes for the data analysis in-between as shown in 
Supplementary Information.

Nevertheless, one cannot run the markdown or script unless having the raw 
dataset. To get raw data, one need to request an access from the BPJS Kesehatan 
for their sample dataset published in August 2019. Up to this date, there are 
three sample datasets they published in February 2019, August 2019, and 
December 2020. For the first and second versions, a request is applied via 
https://e-ppid.bpjs-kesehatan.go.id/, while the third is applied via 
https://data.bpjs-kesehatan.go.id.

To preprocess the raw data into the input dataset of this study, follow the 
codes of the R Markdown in data.Rmd:
